LBTAS API — entry point
========================

Minimal FastAPI app. This is the starting scaffold for the networked API
described in CLAUDE.md ("What the API does"). POST /ratings runs a submission
through the -1 comment validation rule and persists it (rejecting a repeat
submission for the same exchange/rater/rated_party with 409); GET
/ratings/{rated_party}/{role} reads back a distribution (never an average)
plus first/last rated timestamps and a transaction count, per CLAUDE.md's
"Reading and reporting reputation" and "data model" sections. Reads are
role-scoped per SPEC.md §3: a rating earned in one role must never
contaminate another role's distribution.

Events persist to a local SQLite file (api/event_store.py) so ratings survive
a restart, per CLAUDE.md's "Storing ratings locally" requirement.

Reads are gated behind LBTAS_API_KEY (see require_api_key below) so an
unconfigured deployment fails closed, per CLAUDE.md's authorization section.
Writes are not yet gated — CLAUDE.md treats submission and review as separate
capabilities, and only the read side was flagged as unauthorized in review;
gating submission is a separate, not-yet-built piece. Running this on
NTARIHQ is likewise separate.

POST /ratings/{event_id}/dismiss lets an adjudicator dismiss a bad-faith
rating (SPEC.md §4, §6): the dismissal is its own append-only annotation,
never an edit or delete of the original event. GET /ratings/{party}/{role}
computes its distribution from active (non-dismissed) events only, but
always surfaces every dismissed event alongside it, with who dismissed it
and why — dismissal forgives, it does not hide. There is no distinct
adjudicator identity yet; dismissal is gated behind the same LBTAS_API_KEY
as reads, which is coarser than SPEC.md's "operator-local adjudicator role."

POST /ratings/{event_id}/contest lets the rated party dispute a rating made
against them, in either direction (SPEC.md §5 — the covenant is symmetric,
no privileged side); it is ungated, like POST /ratings, since it's the rated
party exercising their own right rather than a privileged review. POST
/ratings/{event_id}/uphold is the adjudicator's other resolution besides
dismissal: the rating stands, but GET marks it "contested" and "upheld" (with
who and why) rather than silently leaving it looking unquestioned.

POST /exchanges registers an exchange's two rating directions and starts its
rating window (SPEC.md §7); ungated, same posture as POST /ratings. POST
/exchanges/{exchange_id}/apply-timeouts backfills a system-attributed +2 for
any direction still unrated once the window has elapsed — there's no
background worker here, so a real deployment calls this from an external
scheduler. It's gated behind LBTAS_API_KEY, same as dismiss/uphold. GET marks
a timeout default as "defaulted" so it's never mistaken for an affirmed
rating, and surfaces a party/role's defaulted_count.
