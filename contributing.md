## Licensing: inbound = outbound (NTARI DCO)

Contributions are accepted under a **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**
sign-off (see the `DCO` file). Your contribution is licensed under this
project's existing AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE` — inbound matches outbound, there is no
CLA, and **copyright stays with you**. Because copyright remains distributed
across all contributors, no single party — including NTARI — can relicense the
corpus without unanimous consent.

Sign off every commit with `-s` (e.g. `git commit -s -m "..."`), which appends
your `Signed-off-by` trailer. A DCO check runs on each pull request against
`main`; if you forget, the failed check lists the commits to fix
(`git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff` for one, `git rebase --signoff HEAD~N`
for several, then `git push --force-with-lease`).
